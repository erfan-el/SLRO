# Decision Mining Knowledge Graph

The Decision Mining Knowledge Graph (DM-KG) instantiates the Systematic Literature Review Ontology - Decision Mining (SLRO-DM) with concrete papers, authors, research problems, their solutions and characterizations, from our SLR.

The [`DM-KG.ttl`](DM-KG.ttl) file includes SLRO-DM and its instantiation as the DM-KG. The persistent URL (PURL) for referencing the latest version of DM-KG and SLRO-DM ontology: [https://purl.archive.org/slro.owl](https://purl.archive.org/slro.owl).

The [`Competency questions.md`](<Competency questions.md>) file lists a number of competency questions for DM practitioners and researchers.
