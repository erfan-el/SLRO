# Decision Mining Knowledge Graph

The Decision Mining Knowledge Graph (DM-KG) instantiates the Systematic Literature Review Ontology - Decision Mining (SLRO-DM) with concrete papers, authors, research problems, their solutions and characterizations, from our SLR.

The [`DM-KG.ttl`](DM-KG.ttl) file includes SLRO-DM and its instantiation as the DM-KG.  

The persistent URL (PURL) are as follows (currently pointing to the same artifact):
- SLRO: [https://purl.archive.org/slro.owl](https://purl.archive.org/slro.owl)
- SLRO-DM and DM-KG: [https://purl.archive.org/slr/decisionmining.owl](https://purl.archive.org/slr/decisionmining.owl)

The [`Competency questions.md`](<Competency questions.md>) file lists a number of competency questions for DM practitioners and researchers.
